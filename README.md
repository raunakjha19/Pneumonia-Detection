# Pneumonia-Detection
"CNN-based Pneumonia Detection project. Contains a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) implementing a Convolutional Neural Network for pneumonia detection in chest X-ray images, trained on both Dataset A and Dataset B."

Phase 1: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

Objective: Establish a baseline performance for your image classification task using a CNN. This will be your benchmark against which you compare subsequent models.

Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Make sure data is loaded correctly. Proper normalization is essential.

Model Architecture: Design a CNN architecture suitable for your task. You've already started with one, but consider experimenting with different numbers of layers, filter sizes, and activation functions. Common architectures include:

Simple CNN: A few convolutional layers followed by max pooling, flattening, and dense layers.

More Complex Architectures: VGG16, ResNet, Inception (via Transfer Learning).

Training and Validation:

Use a validation set to monitor performance during training and prevent overfitting.

Implement early stopping to halt training when validation performance plateaus or starts to decrease.

Save the best-performing CNN model (based on validation metrics).

Evaluation:

Evaluate the CNN on a held-out test set to obtain an unbiased estimate of its performance.

Calculate relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC) to assess the model's strengths and weaknesses.

Deliverables:

A trained and evaluated CNN model.

Baseline performance metrics on the test set.

Code for data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.

Phase 2: Traditional ML Models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Objective: Explore the performance of traditional machine learning models for your image classification task. These models typically require feature extraction from the images before they can be used.

Key Steps:

Feature Extraction:

Use pre-trained CNNs (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) as feature extractors. Remove the final classification layer from the CNN and use the output of a preceding layer as the feature vector for each image.

Alternatively, use other feature extraction techniques like HOG, SIFT, or SURF (though these are less commonly used now with the success of CNNs).

Model Training and Validation:

Train each traditional ML model (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) using the extracted features and corresponding labels.

Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance.

Track performance on a validation set during training.

Evaluation:

Evaluate each trained model on the same test set used for the CNN baseline.

Compare the performance of the traditional ML models to the CNN baseline using the same metrics.

Deliverables:

Trained and evaluated SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models (using extracted features).

Performance metrics for each model on the test set.

Code for feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Phase 3: Ensemble Methods

Objective: Combine the predictions of multiple models (CNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to potentially improve overall performance. Ensemble methods often outperform individual models by leveraging their diverse strengths.

Key Steps:

Select Models: Choose the best-performing models from Phases 1 and 2 to include in the ensemble.

Ensemble Techniques: Implement ensemble methods, such as:

Voting: Combine predictions by averaging (for probabilities) or taking the majority vote (for class labels).

Stacking: Train a meta-learner (another model) to combine the predictions of the base learners.

Training and Validation (for Stacking): If using stacking, train the meta-learner on the predictions of the base learners using a separate validation set.

Evaluation:

Evaluate the ensemble model on the test set.

Compare its performance to the individual models from Phases 1 and 2.

Deliverables:

An ensemble model combining predictions from multiple base learners.

Performance metrics for the ensemble model on the test set.

Code for ensemble creation, training (if stacking), and evaluation.

Phase 4: Comparison and Analysis

Objective: Systematically compare the performance of all models (CNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Ensemble) and draw conclusions about their effectiveness for your image classification task.

Key Steps:

Consolidated Results: Create a table summarizing the performance metrics for each model on the test set.

Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to determine whether the differences in performance between models are statistically significant.

Qualitative Analysis: Analyze the types of errors each model makes (e.g., by examining the confusion matrix) to gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

Conclusions: Draw conclusions about which models are best suited for your task, considering factors like accuracy, precision, recall, computational cost, and interpretability.

Deliverables:

A report summarizing the performance of all models, including a comparison table, statistical analysis, and qualitative analysis of errors.

Well-documented code for all models and evaluation procedures.
